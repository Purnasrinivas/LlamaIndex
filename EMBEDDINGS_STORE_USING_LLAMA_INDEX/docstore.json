Introduction\nRICH DAD POOR DAD1\nI had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly \neducated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years \nof undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to \nStanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern \nUniversity to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. \nThe other father never finished the eighth grade.\nBoth men were successful in their careers, working hard all their \nlives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled \nfinancially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. \nOne died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and \nhis church. The other left bills to be paid.\nBoth men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men \noffered me advice, but they did not advise the same things.

Both were just starting out on their careers, and \nboth were struggling with money and families. But they had very \ndifferent points of view about money.\nFor example, one dad would say, \u201cThe love of money is the root \nof all evil.\u201d The other said, \u201cThe lack of money is the root of all evil.\u201d\nAs a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me \nwas difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers \ndid not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, \nparticularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and \nintrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about \nwhat each was saying.\nMuch of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself \nquestions such as, \u201cWhy does he say that?\u201d and then asking the same \nquestion of the other dad\u2019s statement. It would have been much \neasier to simply say, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s right.

As a \nprocess, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in \nthe long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.\nOne of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and \nthe middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is \ntaught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from \nour parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? \nThey simply say, \u201cStay in school and study hard.\u201d The child may \ngraduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person\u2019s financial \nprogramming and mindset.\nSadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic \nand professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how \nsmart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades \nmay struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt \nis due in large part to highly educated politicians and government \nofficials making financial decisions with little or no training in the  \nsubject of money.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2009cd6-e3a0-4c4a-8489-4fdd0f3cc3b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2009cd6-e3a0-4c4a-8489-4fdd0f3cc3b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2f339ce-6ff2-45b3-a2c1-da1417dcbfb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "d91b65baa53f314f007cbf5a9d9bf6e6c23199e6c049ea5859d23a5657af5f19"}}, "hash": "1841226c8c13d3518cd788ceffb6d61a3907dc83de910e50bcbecc892214faa2", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad3\nToday I often wonder what will soon happen when we have \nmillions of people who need financial and medical assistance.

How will a nation survive if teaching children about \nmoney continues to be left to parents\u2014most of whom will be, or \nalready are, poor?\nBecause I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of \nthem. I had to think about each dad\u2019s advice, and in doing so, I \ngained valuable insight into the power and effect of one\u2019s thoughts on \none\u2019s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, \u201cI can\u2019t afford \nit.\u201d The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask,  \n\u201cHow can I afford it?\u201d One is a statement, and the other is a question. \nOne lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My  \nsoon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the \nwords \u201cI can\u2019t afford it,\u201d your brain stops working. By asking the \nquestion \u201cHow can I afford it?\u201d your brain is put to work. He did  \nnot mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical \nabout exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the  \nworld. He\u2019d say, \u201cMy brain gets stronger every day because I exercise  \nit. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.\u201d He believed that \nautomatically saying \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d was a sign of mental laziness.\nAlthough both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a \nhabit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the \nother had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was \nthat one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It \nis not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise \non a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching \ntelevision. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, \nand proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. \nMy two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way \nthey thought.

It\u2019s a business secret.\u201d\nMy mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a \nsite next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our \nraw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup \nbottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.\nFinally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors\u2019 \nmessy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. \u201cWhat are you \nboys doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to hear again that it\u2019s a business \nsecret.

We informed her \nthat we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste \nso we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.\nThe date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was \non. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction \nnotice by my own mom! It became Mike\u2019s job to tell the neighbors to \nquickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to \nbrush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.\nOne day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old \nboys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. \nThere was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small \nmilk cartons from school, and our family\u2019s hibachi grill was glowing \nwith red-hot coals at maximum heat.\nDad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of \nthe driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and \nhis friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in \nwhich the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, \ntoothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of \nlead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the \nsmall steel pot.

On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the \nroad and parking lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the \nparking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store. We knew we had  \na job as long as there was no air-conditioning.\nFor three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked \nour three hours.

My real dad, the one I call the poor one, thought that my rich dad \nwas violating child labor laws and should be investigated.\nMy educated, poor dad told me to demand what I deserve\u2014at least \n25 cents an hour. My poor dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I \nwas to quit immediately.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need that damned job anyway,\u201d said my poor dad  \nwith indignation.\nAt eight o\u2019clock Saturday morning, I walked through the door of \nMike\u2019s house when Mike\u2019s dad opened it.\n\u201cTake a seat and wait in line,\u201d he said as I entered. He turned and  \ndisappeared into his little office next to a bedroom.\nI looked around the room and didn\u2019t see Mike anywhere. Feeling \nawkward, I cautiously sat down next to the same two women who were \nthere four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid down the couch to make \nroom for me.\nForty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women \nhad met with him and left 30 minutes earlier. An older gentleman was \nin there for 20 minutes and was also gone.\nThe house was empty, and here I sat in a musty, dark living room \non a beautiful sunny Hawaiian day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who \nexploited children. I could hear him rustling around the office, talking \non the phone, and ignoring me. I was ready to walk out, but for some \nreason I stayed.\nFinally, 15 minutes later, at exactly nine o\u2019clock, rich dad walked out \nof his office, said nothing, and signaled with his hand for me to enter.\n\u201cI understand you want a raise, or you\u2019re going to quit,\u201d rich dad \nsaid as he swiveled in his office chair.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not keeping your end of the bargain,\u201d I blurted out, \nnearly in tears. It was really frightening for me to confront a grown-up.\n\u201cYou said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I\u2019ve \nworked for you. I\u2019ve worked hard. I\u2019ve given up my baseball games to \nwork for you, but you haven\u2019t kept your word, and you haven\u2019t taught", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19254959-3a5d-42cf-ad23-081c9216b71a": {"__data__": {"id_": "19254959-3a5d-42cf-ad23-081c9216b71a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ae6afec-fafc-43a4-95d3-7197d7ab4aa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "e66dd9efadcc2115e9d8c5ee216f853692cd87f5bd3af1b9d371e7d4eee82e56"}}, "hash": "e66dd9efadcc2115e9d8c5ee216f853692cd87f5bd3af1b9d371e7d4eee82e56", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad19\nme anything.

I was talking to someone who needed to be locked up.\n\u201cIf you learn life\u2019s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just \ncontinue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life \npush them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push \nback against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They  \ndo not know it\u2019s life that\u2019s pushing.\u201d\nI had no idea what he was talking about.\n\u201cLife pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others \nfight.

Most quit, and a few like \nyou fight.\u201d\nRich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that \nneeded repair. \u201cIf you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise, \nwealthy, and happy young man. If you don\u2019t, you will spend your  \nlife blaming a job, low pay, or your boss for your problems. You\u2019ll  \nlive life always hoping for that big break that will solve all your  \nmoney problems.\u201d\nRich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes \nmet mine. We stared at each other, communicating through our eyes. \nFinally, I looked away once I had absorbed his message. I knew he \nwas right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting.\nRich dad continued, \u201cOr if you\u2019re the kind of person who has \nno guts, you just give up every time life pushes you. If you\u2019re that \nkind of person, you\u2019ll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right \nthings, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then you \ndie a boring old man. You\u2019ll have lots of friends who really like you \nbecause you were such a nice hardworking guy. But the truth is that \nyou let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified \nof taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was \ngreater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only \nyou will know you didn\u2019t go for it.

If you hadn\u2019t got angry and had \nsimply accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you. \nYou see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire.

Let me explain the other emotion: desire. Some  \ncall it greed, but I prefer desire. It\u2019s perfectly normal to desire something \nbetter, prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money \nbecause of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. \nBut the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need \nmore money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more \nsecurity.

The fears that drove them to get rich \ngot worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming \nlouder. They don\u2019t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life \nmoney has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say \nif they lost all their money.

We will always have \nemotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it\u2019s imperative for you \nto use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not \nlet your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and \ngreed against themselves. That\u2019s the start of ignorance.

Among \nthem were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel \ncompany; Samuel Insull, president of the world\u2019s largest utility; \nHoward Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger, \npresident of International Match Co., one of the world\u2019s largest \ncompanies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of \nInternational Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the \nNew York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore, \ntwo of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of \nPresident Harding\u2019s cabinet.

Insull died broke in a \nforeign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson \nwent insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison, \nand Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.\nI doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men.  \nIf you look at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash \nand the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on \nthese men and their lives.

Everyone has \nliving expenses, the need for food, shelter, and clothing. The diagrams \nshow the flow of cash through a poor, middle-class, and wealthy \nperson\u2019s life. It is the cash flow that tells the story of how a person \nhandles their money.\nThe reason I started with the story of the richest men in America \nis to illustrate the flaw in believing that money will solve all problems. \nThat is why I cringe whenever I hear people ask me how to get rich \nquicker, or where they should start. I often hear, \u201cI\u2019m in debt, so I need \nto make more money.\u201d\nBut more money will often not solve the problem. In fact, it may \ncompound the problem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human \nflaws, putting a spotlight on what we \ndon\u2019t know. That is why, all too often, a \nperson who comes into a sudden windfall \nof cash\u2014let\u2019s say an inheritance, a pay \nraise, or lottery winnings\u2014soon returns \nto the same financial mess, if not worse, than the mess they were in \nbefore.

Increased \nspending throws families into greater debt and into more financial \nuncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and \nreceiving raises on a regular basis. This is high-risk living caused by \nweak financial education.\nThe massive loss of jobs in recent times proves how shaky the \nmiddle class really is financially. Company pension plans are being \nreplaced by 401(k) plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and \ncan\u2019t be relied upon as a source for retirement. Panic has set in for  \nthe middle class. \nToday, mutual funds are popular because they supposedly \nrepresent safety. Average mutual-fund buyers are too busy working to \npay taxes and mortgages, save for their children\u2019s college, and pay off \ncredit cards. They do not have time to study investing, so they rely \non the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the \nmutual fund includes many different types of investments, they feel \ntheir money is safer because it is \u201cdiversified.\u201d This educated middle \nclass subscribes to the dogma put out by mutual-fund brokers and \nfinancial planners: \u201cPlay it safe. Avoid risk.\u201d\nThe real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what \ncreates the risk faced by average middle-class people. The reason they have \nto play it safe is because their financial positions are tenuous at best. Their \nbalance sheets are not balanced. Instead, they are loaded with liabilities \nand have no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source \nof income is their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent \non their employer. So when genuine \u201cdeals of a lifetime\u201d come along, \nthese people can\u2019t take advantage of them because they are working so \nhard, are taxed to the max, and are loaded with debt.\nAs I said at the start of this section, the most important rule \nis to know the difference between an asset and a liability.

Their lives \nwill revolve around their wages or, as described earlier, their income \ncolumn. Many will study further to become engineers, scientists, \ncooks, police officers, artists, writers, and so on.

They spend their \nlives minding someone else\u2019s business and making that person rich.\nTo become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own \nbusiness. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your \nincome column. As stated earlier, the number-one rule is to know  \nthe difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets.  \nThe rich focus on their asset columns, while everyone else focuses on \ntheir income statements.\nThat is why we hear so often: \u201cI need a raise.\u201d \u201cIf only I had a  \npromotion.\u201d \u201cI am going back to school to get more training so I  \ncan get a better job.\u201d \u201cI am going to \nwork overtime.\u201d \u201cMaybe I can get a \nsecond job.\u201d \nIn some circles, these are sensible \nideas.

Or if there is \na gain on the sale of the assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again, \nthe government takes its share, thus reducing the amount available to \nhelp them out of debt.

The best thing about money is that it works \n24 hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your day job, be a \ngreat hardworking employee, but keep building that asset column.\nAs your cash flow grows, you can indulge in some luxuries. An  \nimportant distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the \npoor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the \nmiddle class often buy luxury items like big houses, diamonds, furs, \njewelry, or boats because they want to look rich. They look rich, but  \nin reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The old-money \npeople, the long-term rich, build their asset column first. Then the \nincome generated from the asset column buys their luxuries. The poor  \nand middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood, and  \nchildren\u2019s inheritance.\nA true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a \nreal asset. For example, when my wife Kim and I had extra money \ncoming from our apartment houses, she went out and bought her \nMercedes. It didn\u2019t take any extra work or risk on her part because \nthe apartment house bought the car. She did, however, have to wait \nfour years while the real estate investment portfolio grew and began \ngenerating enough extra cash flow to pay for the car. But the luxury, \nthe Mercedes, was a true reward because she proved she knew how to \ngrow her asset column.

Occasionally, there were temporary \ntaxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would \nput the word out and ask everyone to \u201cchip in.\u201d Taxes were levied in \nBritain for the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in \nAmerica to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865.\nIn 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. \nIn 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with \nthe adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one \ntime, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the tax on tea that led to the \nfamous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the \nRevolutionary War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and \nthe United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.\nWhat these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes \nwere initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad \nwanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes \nwas made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and \nthe middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is \nhow the masses voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. \nAlthough it was intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up \npunishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.\n\u201cOnce government got a taste of money, its appetite grew,\u201d said rich \ndad. \u201cYour dad and I are exactly opposite.

The \nmore he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization \nbecomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected \norganization. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer \npeople I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my \ninvestors. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like government people.

No matter what the \n\u201ctake-from-the-rich\u201d crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to \noutsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle \nclass. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood \nthe power of money, a subject not taught in schools.\nHow did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the \u201ctake-from-\nthe-rich\u201d tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers. \nInitially, people were happy. Money was handed out to government \nworkers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of  \njobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving \ngovernment contracts. The government received a large pool of money, \nbut the problem was the fiscal management of that money. The \ngovernment ideal is to avoid having excess money. If you fail to spend \nyour allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would \ncertainly not be recognized for being efficient.

There were already \na few assets in my asset column, but now I was determined to focus \non making it bigger.

But for me, focusing on my own \nbusiness and developing assets made me a better employee because  \nI now had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently, amassing \nas much money as possible so I could invest in real estate. Hawaii \nwas just set to boom, and there were fortunes to be made. The more \nI realized that we were in the beginning stages of a boom, the more \nXerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the more money I made \nand, of course, the more deductions came out of my paycheck. It was \ninspiring. I wanted out of the employee trap so badly that I worked \neven harder so I could invest more. By 1978, I was consistently one \nof the top five sales people at the company. I badly wanted out of the \nRat Race.\nIn less than three years, I was making more in my real estate  \nholding corporation than I was making at Xerox. And the money  \nI was making in my asset column in my own corporation was \nmoney working for me, not me pounding on doors selling copiers. \nMy rich dad\u2019s advice made much more sense.

That is a whole area of \nexpertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed, \nand they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns,  \nspends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is \nleft. It\u2019s one of the biggest legal tax  loopholes that the rich \nuse. They\u2019re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own \ninvestments that are producing good cashflow.

A multi-billion-\ndollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born.\nThe evening news came on right after the story of Alexander \nGraham Bell. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a \nlocal company. The workers were angry and complained that the \ncompany ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about \n45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was \nbegging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would \nreconsider his termination.

It has been a great  \nexperience and a rewarding one. It is also a disturbing profession, for  \nI have taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common \nin all of us, myself included. We all have tremendous potential, and \nwe all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back \nis some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical \ninformation that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. \nSome are more affected than others.\nOnce we leave school, most of us know that it is not so much a \nmatter of college degrees or good grades that count. In the real world \noutside of academics, something more than just grades is required.  \nI have heard it called many things; guts, chutzpah, balls, audacity,  \nbravado, cunning, daring, tenacity, and brilliance. This factor,  \nwhatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one\u2019s future much more  \nthan school grades do.\nInside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant, and daring  \ncharacters. There is also the flip side of that character: people who \ncould get down on their knees and beg if necessary. After a year in \nVietnam as a Marine Corps pilot, I got to know both of those  \ncharacters inside of me intimately. One is not better than the other.\nYet as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and  \nself-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It \nbroke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the courage \nto act on the answer. Often in the real world, it\u2019s not the smart who \nget ahead, but the bold.\nIn my personal experience, your financial genius requires both \ntechnical knowledge as well as courage. If fear is too strong, the \ngenius is suppressed. In my classes, I strongly urge students to learn \nto take risks, to be bold, and to let their genius convert that fear into \npower and brilliance. It works for some and just terrifies others. I have \ncome to realize that for most people, when it comes to the subject of \nmoney, they would rather play it safe.

I want to be with people moving boldly forward.  \nI do not want to be with those left behind.\nI will give you a simple example of creating money. In the early \n1990s, the economy of Phoenix, Arizona, was horrible. I was watching a \nTV show when a financial planner came on and began forecasting doom \nand gloom. His advice was to save money. \u201cPut $100 away every month,\u201d \nhe said. \u201cIn 40 years you will be a multimillionaire.\u201d\nWell, putting money away every month is a sound idea. It is one \noption\u2014the option most people subscribe to. The problem is this: It \nblinds the person to what is really going on. It causes them to miss major \nopportunities for much more significant growth of their money. The \nworld is passing them by.\nAs I said, the economy was terrible at that time. For investors, \nthis is the perfect market condition. A chunk of my money was \nin the stock market and in apartment houses. I was short of cash. \nBecause people were giving properties away, I was buying. I was not \nsaving money. I was investing. Kim and I had more than a million \ndollars in cash working in a market that was rising fast. It was the best \nopportunity to invest. The economy was terrible. I just could not pass \nup these small deals.\nHouses that were once $100,000 were now $75,000. But instead \nof shopping with local real estate agents, I began shopping at the \nbankruptcy attorney\u2019s office, or the courthouse steps. In these  \nshopping places, a $75,000 house could sometimes be bought for \n$20,000 or less. For $2,000, which was loaned to me from a friend \nfor 90 days for $200, I gave an attorney a cashier\u2019s check as a down \npayment.

Understanding markets  \nUnderstanding markets is the science of supply and  \ndemand Alexander Graham Bell gave the market what it \nwanted. So did Bill Gates. A $75,000 house offered for \n$60,000 that cost $20,000 was also the result of seizing  \nan opportunity created by the market. Somebody was  \nbuying, and someone was selling.\n4. The law  \nThe law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and \nfederal regulations. I recommend playing by the rules.\nIt is this basic foundation, or the combination of these skills, \nthat is needed to be successful in the pursuit of wealth, whether it be \nthrough the buying of small homes, apartment buildings, companies, \nstocks, bonds, precious metals, baseball cards, or the like.\nA few years later, the real estate market rebounded and everyone \nelse was getting in. The stock market was booming, and everyone  \nwas getting in. The U.S. economy was getting back on its feet. I \nbegan selling and was now traveling to Peru, Norway, Malaysia, and \nthe Philippines. The investment landscape had changed. We were no \nlonger buying real estate. Now I just watch the values climb inside  \nthe asset column and will probably begin selling.

I need to call my accountant to be prepared for  \ncash and seek ways to shelter it.\nThe point I would like to make is that investments come and go. \nThe market goes up and comes down. Economies improve and crash. \nThe world is always handing you opportunities of a lifetime, every day \nof your life, but all too often we fail to see them. But they are there. And \nthe more the world changes and the more technology changes, the more \nopportunities there will be to allow you and your family to be financially \nsecure for generations to come.\nSo why bother developing your financial intelligence? Again, only \nyou can answer that. I know why I continue to learn and develop. I do \nit because I know there are changes coming. I\u2019d rather welcome change \nthan cling to the past. I know there will be market booms and market \ncrashes. I want to continually develop my financial intelligence because, \nat each market change, some people will be on their knees begging \nfor their jobs. Others, meanwhile, will take the lemons that life hands \nthem\u2014and we are all handed lemons occasionally\u2014and turn them into \nmillions. That\u2019s financial intelligence.\nI am often asked about the lemons I have turned into millions.  \nI hesitate using many more examples of personal investments because  \nI am afraid it comes across as bragging or tooting my own horn.  \nThat is not my intention. I use the examples only as numerical \nand chronological illustrations of actual and simple cases. I use the \nexamples because I want you to know that it is easy. And the more \nfamiliar you become with the four pillars of financial intelligence, the \neasier it becomes.\nPersonally, I use two main vehicles to achieve financial growth:  \nreal estate and small-cap stocks. I use real estate as my foundation.  \nDay in and day out, my properties provide cash flow and occasional \nspurts of growth in value. The small-cap stocks are used for fast growth. \nI do not recommend anything that I do. The examples are just  \nthat\u2014examples.

It was a suburb that had little gingerbread houses. They  \nwere small and cute. I almost expected to see Little Red Riding Hood  \nskipping down the sidewalk on her way to Granny\u2019s.\nThere were \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs everywhere. The timber market was  \nterrible, the stock market had just crashed, and the economy was  \ndepressed. On one street, I noticed a for-sale sign that was up longer \nthan most. It looked old. Jogging past it one day, I ran into the \nowner, who looked troubled.\n\u201cWhat are you asking for your house?\u201d I asked.\nThe owner turned and smiled weakly. \u201cMake me an offer,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been for sale for over a year. Nobody even comes by anymore to \nlook at it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll look,\u201d I said, and I bought the house a half hour later for \n$20,000 less than his asking price.\nIt was a cute little two-bedroom home, with gingerbread trim on \nall the windows. It was light blue with gray accents and had been built \nin 1930. Inside there was a beautiful rock fireplace, as well as two tiny \nbedrooms. It was a perfect rental house.\nI gave the owner $5,000 down for a $45,000 house that was really \nworth $65,000, except that no one wanted to buy it.

Hardly exciting.\nA year later, the depressed Oregon real estate market had begun \nto pick up. California investors, flush with money from their still \nbooming real estate market, were moving north and buying up Oregon \nand Washington. I sold that little house for $95,000 to a young \ncouple from California who thought it was a bargain. My capital \ngains of approximately $40,000 were placed into a 1031 tax-deferred \nexchange, and I went shopping for a place to put my money. In about \na month, I found a 12-unit apartment house right next to the Intel \nplant in Beaverton, Oregon. The owners lived in Germany, had no idea \nwhat the place was worth, and again, \njust wanted to get out of it. I offered \n$275,000 for a $450,000 building. \nThey agreed to $300,000. I bought it \nand held it for two years. Utilizing the \nsame 1031-exchange process, we sold \nthe building for $495,000 and bought a \n30-unit apartment building in Phoenix, \nArizona. We had moved to Phoenix by then to get out of the rain, and \nneeded to sell anyway. Like the former Oregon market, the real estate \nmarket in Phoenix was depressed. The price of the 30-unit apartment \nbuilding in Phoenix was $875,000, with $225,000 down. The cash \nflow from the 30 units was a little over $5,000 a month.\nThe Arizona market began moving up and, a few years later, a \nColorado investor offered us $1.2 million for the property.\nThe point of this example is how a small amount can grow into \na large amount. Again, it is a matter of understanding financial \nstatements, investment strategies, a sense of the market, and the laws. \nIf people are not versed in these subjects, then obviously they must  \nfollow standard dogma, which is to play it safe, diversify, and only \ninvest in secure investments.

It is technically illegal to offer speculative deals to \nsomeone who is considered not sophisticated, but of course it happens. \nThe more sophisticated I get, the more opportunities come my way. \nAnother case for developing your financial intelligence over a \nlifetime is simply that more opportunities are presented to you. And \nthe greater your financial intelligence, the easier it is to tell whether \na deal is good. It\u2019s your intelligence that can spot a bad deal, or make \na bad deal good.

Six \nmonths later, the company is listed, and the 100,000 shares now are \nworth $2 each. If the company is well managed, the price keeps going \nup, and the stock may go to $20 or more per share.

The idea in \nanything is to use your technical knowledge, wisdom, and love of \nthe game to cut the odds down, to lower the risk. Of course, there is \nalways risk. It is financial intelligence that improves the odds. Thus, \nwhat is risky for one person is less risky to someone else. That is the \nprimary reason I constantly encourage people to invest more in their \nfinancial education than in stocks, real estate, or other markets. The \nsmarter you are, the better chance you have of beating the odds.\nThe stock plays I personally invested in were extremely high-risk for \nmost people and absolutely not recommended. I have been playing that \ngame since 1979 and have paid more than my share in dues. But if you \nwill reread why investments such as these are high-risk for most people, \nyou may be able to set your life up differently, so that the ability to take \n$25,000 and turn it into $1 million in a year is low-risk for you.\nAs stated earlier, nothing I have written is a recommendation.

If you keep \nyour living expenses modest, $100,000 \ncoming in as additional income is \npleasant, regardless of whether you \nwork.

It \nis not a pretty picture for most people working today. And that is just \nfor retirement. Add medical fees and long-term nursing-home care \nand  the picture is frightening. \nAlready, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine \nneed to make tough decisions such as, \u201cWho will live, and who will \ndie?\u201d They make those decisions purely on how much money they \nhave and how old the patients are. If the patient is old, they often will \ngive the medical care to someone younger. The older poor patient \ngets put to the back of the line. Just as the rich can afford better \neducation, the rich will be able to keep themselves alive, while those \nwho have little wealth will die.\nSo I wonder: Are workers looking into the future or just until \ntheir next paycheck, never questioning where they are headed?\nWhen I speak to adults who want to earn more money, I always  \nrecommend the same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life.  \nInstead of simply working for the money and security, which I admit \nare important, I suggest they take a second job that will teach them \na second skill. Often I recommend joining a network-marketing \ncompany, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales \nskills. Some of these companies have excellent training programs that \nhelp people get over their fear of failure and rejection, which are the \nmain reasons people are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable \nthan money, in the long run.\nWhen I offer this suggestion, I often hear in response, \u201cOh that is \ntoo much hassle,\u201d or \u201cI only want to do what I am interested in.\u201d\nIf they say, \u201cIt\u2019s too much of a hassle,\u201d I ask, \u201cSo you would  \nrather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the \ngovernment?\u201d If they tell me, \u201cI only do what I am interested in,\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d064b110-2218-4238-8a27-9322ed766849": {"__data__": {"id_": "d064b110-2218-4238-8a27-9322ed766849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "384bb0eb-67a3-4ed9-8b12-92af850bde69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "abf8d70d51e9a76067edf5a1136f6d635c10173c20f910010ec60f315a94e71f"}}, "hash": "abf8d70d51e9a76067edf5a1136f6d635c10173c20f910010ec60f315a94e71f", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad123\nI say, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in going to the gym, but I go because I want \nto feel better and live longer.\u201d\nUnfortunately, there is some truth to the old statement, \u201cYou can\u2019t \nteach an old dog new tricks.\u201d Unless a person is used to changing, it\u2019s \nhard to change.\nBut for those of you who might be on the fence when it comes  \nto the idea of working to learn something new, I offer this word  \nof encouragement: Life is much like going to the gym. The most  \npainful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it\u2019s easy. There \nhave been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am \nthere and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is over, I am \nalways glad I talked myself into going.\nIf you are unwilling to work to learn something new and instead \ninsist on becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the  \ncompany you work for is unionized. Labor unions are designed to \nprotect specialists. My educated dad, after falling from grace with \nthe governor, became the head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He \ntold me that it was the hardest job he ever held. My rich dad, on the \nother hand, spent his life doing his best to keep his companies from \nbecoming unionized. He was successful. Although the unions came \nclose, rich dad was always able to fight them off. \nPersonally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and \nthe benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become \nhighly specialized. Then seek union protection. For example, had I \ncontinued with my flying career, I would have sought a company that \nhad a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated \nto learning a skill that was valuable in only one industry. If I were \npushed out of that industry, my life\u2019s skills would not be as valuable \nto another industry. A displaced senior pilot\u2014with 100,000 hours of \nheavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year\u2014would have a \nhard time finding an equivalent high-paying job teaching in school. \nSkills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry.

With all the changes in \nmedicine, many medical specialists are needing to conform to medical \norganizations such as HMOs. Schoolteachers definitely need to be \nunion members. Today in America, the teachers union is the largest \nand the richest labor union of all. The NEA, the National Education \nAssociation, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need the \nprotection of their union because their skills are also of limited value \nto an industry outside of education. So the rule of thumb is: \u201cHighly \nspecialized; then unionize.\u201d It\u2019s the smart thing to do.\nWhen I ask the classes I teach, \u201cHow many of you can cook a  \nbetter hamburger than McDonald\u2019s?\u201d almost all the students \nraise their hands. I then ask, \u201cSo if most of you can cook a better \nhamburger, how come McDonald\u2019s makes more money than you?\u201d\nThe answer is obvious: McDonald\u2019s is excellent at business \nsystems. The reason so many talented people are poor is because they \nfocus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing \nabout business systems. \nA friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable \namount of money. One day his mother\u2019s attorney called to tell him \nthat she had left him $35,000.

He received no replies from the ad,  \nand all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the \nmagazine for misrepresentation.\nThis is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful  \nhamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what \nhe learned, his only reply was, \u201cAdvertising salespeople are crooks.\u201d \nI then asked him if he would be willing to take a course in sales and \na course in direct marketing.

That was his view on how to  \nbe paid more.

They hate losing, so they \nknow that losing will only inspire them to become better. There is a \nbig difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. Most \npeople are so afraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke \nover a duplex. Financially, they play life too safe and too small. \nThey buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments. The \nmain reason that over 90 percent of the American public struggles \nfinancially is because they play not to lose. They don\u2019t play to win.\nThey go to their financial planners or accountants or stockbrokers \nand buy a balanced portfolio. Most have lots of cash in CDs, low-yield \nbonds, mutual funds that can be traded within a mutual-fund family, \nand a few individual stocks. It is a safe and sensible portfolio. But it is \nnot a winning portfolio. It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s probably a better portfolio than more \nthan 70 percent of the population has, and that\u2019s frightening. It\u2019s \na great portfolio for someone who loves safety. But playing it safe \nand balanced on your investment portfolio is not the way successful \ninvestors play the game. If you have little money and you want to \nbe rich, you must first be focused, not balanced. If you look at any \nsuccessful person, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people \ngo nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make progress, you must first \ngo unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress walking.\nThomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill Gates was \nnot balanced.

They criticize instead of analyze.\n\u201cI-don\u2019t-wants hold the key to your success,\u201d rich dad would say.  \nBecause I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property  \nmanager who does fix toilets. And by finding a great property manager \nwho runs houses or apartments, well, my cash flow goes up. But, more \nimportantly, a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real \nestate since I don\u2019t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to \nsuccess in real estate. Finding a good manager is more important to me \nthan the real estate. A great property manager often hears of great deals \nbefore real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable.\nThat is what rich dad meant by \u201cI-don\u2019t-wants hold the key to \nyour success.\u201d Because I do not want to fix toilets either, I figured out", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63599f86-788c-4b6e-9dfc-41712544af33": {"__data__": {"id_": "63599f86-788c-4b6e-9dfc-41712544af33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8cd08dc-8017-4fad-ba2f-1bf332dc00b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "ac0ef244ffcc23492755c847c85524046454fd206d7b2d15708493c853abec98"}}, "hash": "7dd0ff434ae6de7390a3ca74a016674a4a88e96c0560ed4c0376f9d0dd2702a6", "text": "Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles138\nhow to buy more real estate and expedite my getting out of the Rat \nRace. The people who continue to say \u201cI don\u2019t want to fix toilets\u201d often \ndeny themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are \nmore important than their freedom.\nIn the stock market, I often hear people say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose \nmoney.\u201d Well, what makes them think I or anyone else likes losing  \nmoney? They don\u2019t make money because they choose to not lose  \nmoney. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful \ninvestment vehicle, the stock market.\nI was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He \nlooked up and saw that the price of gas was going up and thus the \nprice of oil. My friend is a worry wart or a Chicken Little. To him, the \nsky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him.\nWhen we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the  \nprice of oil was going to go up over the next few years, statistics I had \nnever seen before, even though I already owned substantial shares of  \nan existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began \nlooking for and found a new, undervalued oil company that was  \nabout to find some oil deposits. My broker was excited about this  \nnew company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per share.\nThree months later, this same friend and I drove by the same gas \nstation, and sure enough, the price per gallon had gone up nearly  \n15 percent. Again, the Chicken Little worried and complained. I \nsmiled because, a month earlier, that little oil company hit oil and \nthose 15,000 shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had \nfirst given me the tip. And the price of gas will continue to go up if \nwhat my friend says is true. \nIf most people understood how a \u201cstop\u201d worked in stock-market  \ninvesting, there would be more people investing to win instead of  \ninvesting not to lose. A stop is simply a computer command that  \nsells your stock automatically if the price begins to drop, helping to \nminimize your losses and maximize some gains. It\u2019s a great tool for \nthose who are terrified of losing.\nSo whenever I hear people focusing on their I-don\u2019t-wants, rather \nthan what they do want, I know the noise in their head must be loud. \nChicken Little has taken over their brain and is yelling, \u201cThe sky is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d88760f-abaf-41c9-a1af-f8d0030761be": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d88760f-abaf-41c9-a1af-f8d0030761be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ab039c7-3c01-493e-913f-8bd1ef705759", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "85162336566f1ae84851eb393251052abb6bfb4f1924491f66d932ffd322850a"}}, "hash": "32f6a3f106e24b726a39686514dda3adabf11448b2c2c8d95b3b70f722128901", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad139\nfalling, and toilets are breaking!\u201d So they avoid their don\u2019t-wants, but \nthey pay a huge price.

It wasn\u2019t enough. He went around \nthe country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down \n1,009 times before someone said yes. And he went on to become a \nmultimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. \u201cHe was a \nbrave and tenacious man,\u201d rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.\nSo when you\u2019re in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what \nColonel Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it.\nOvercoming Laziness\nBusy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a  \nbusinessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a \ngood provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the \noffice and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home \nto an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and \nhis wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship \nstrong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work \nslips and he loses his job.\nToday, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their \nwealth. And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The \ncause is the same. They\u2019re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding \nsomething they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep \ndown they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with \nanger or irritation.\nIf they aren\u2019t busy at work or with the kids, they\u2019re often busy \nwatching TV, fishing, playing golf, or shopping. Yet deep down \nthey know they are avoiding something important. That\u2019s the most \ncommon form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.\nSo what is the cure for laziness? The answer is\u2014a little greed.\nFor many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad. \n\u201cGreedy people are bad people,\u201d my mom used to say.

Many rich families lose their assets in the next \ngeneration simply because there was no one trained to be a good \nsteward over their assets.\nMost people choose not to be rich.

Having no money should not be an excuse to  \nnot learn. But that is a choice we all make daily: the choice of what we  \ndo with our time, our money, and what we put in our heads. That is  \nthe power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and  \nI make that choice every day.\nInvest first in education. In reality, the only real asset you have is your \nmind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Each of us has the \nchoice of what we put in our brain once we\u2019re old enough. You can watch \nTV, read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial \nplanning. You choose. Most people simply buy investments rather than \nfirst investing in learning about investing.\nA friend of mine recently had her apartment burglarized. The \nthieves took her electronics and left all the books.

I spent $385 and that course \nhas made me at least $2 million, if not more. But more importantly, it \nbought me life.

If you don\u2019t want to be a cook anymore, then \nyou need to study something else. \nWhen it comes to money, the masses generally have one basic  \nformula they learned in school and it\u2019s this: Work for money. The  \npredominant formula I see in the world is that every day millions of \npeople get up, go to work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks, \nbuy some mutual funds, and go back to work. That is the basic  \nformula, or recipe.\nIf you\u2019re tired of what you\u2019re doing, or you\u2019re not making enough, \nit\u2019s simply a case of changing the formula via which you make money.\nYears ago, when I was 26, I took a weekend class called \u201cHow to \nBuy Real Estate Foreclosures.\u201d I learned a formula. The next trick was \nto have the discipline to actually put into action what I had learned. \nThat is where most people stop. For three years, while working for  \nXerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying  \nforeclosures. I\u2019ve made several million dollars using that formula.\nSo after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas. \nFor many of the classes, I did not directly use the information I learned, \nbut I always learned something new.\nI have attended classes designed for derivative traders, commodity  \noption traders, and chaologists. I was way out of my league, being in a \nroom full of people with doctorates in nuclear physics and space science. \nYet, I learned a lot that made my stock and real estate investing more \nmeaningful and lucrative.\nMost junior colleges and community colleges have classes on  \nfinancial planning and buying traditional investments. They are good \nplaces to start, but I always search for a faster formula. That is why, \non a fairly regular basis, I make more in a day than many people will \nmake in their lifetime.\nAnother side note: In today\u2019s fast-changing world, it\u2019s not so much \nwhat you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is \nold. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless.

Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline \nIf you cannot get control of yourself, do not try to get rich. It \nmakes no sense to invest, make money, and blow it. It is the lack of  \nself-discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after  \nwinning millions. It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who \nget a raise to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise.\nIt is difficult to say which of the 10 steps is the most important.  \nBut of all the steps, this step is probably the most difficult to master \nif it is not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to say that \npersonal self-discipline is the number-one delineating factor between \nthe rich, the poor, and the middle class.\nSimply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for \nfinancial pressure can never be rich. As I have said, a lesson learned from \nmy rich dad was that the world will push you around. The world pushes \npeople around, not because other people are bullies, but because the \nindividual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack internal \nfortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.\nIn the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people \nto not focus on their product, service, or widget, but to focus on \ndeveloping management skills. The three most important management \nskills necessary to start your own business are management of:\n1. Cash flow\n2. People\n3. Personal time\nI would say the skills to manage these three apply to anything, not \njust entrepreneurs. The three matter in the way you live your life as an \nindividual, or as part of a family, a business, a charitable organization, \na city, or a nation.\nEach of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self-discipline.  \nI do not take the saying, \u201cPay yourself first,\u201d lightly.\nThe statement, \u201cPay yourself first,\u201d comes from George Clason\u2019s \nbook, The Richest Man in Babylon.

It rents for $2,500 a month for four months out of \nthe year. For rental during the off-season, it rents for only $1,000 a \nmonth. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this \nasset, which pumps money out for me, month in and month out.\nThe same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker calls and  \nrecommends I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a \ncompany that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value \nto the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money \nin for a week to a month while the stock moves up. Then I pull my \ninitial dollar amount out, and stop worrying about the fluctuations of \nthe market, because my initial money is back and ready to work on \nanother asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own \nan asset that was technically free.\nT rue, I have lost money on many occasions, but I only play with \nmoney I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average 10 investments, \nI hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I \nlose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in \nat that time.The sophisticated  \ninvestor\u2019s first  \nquestion is: \n\u201cHow fast do I get my \nmoney back?\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bc13960-d899-4521-9300-ae20e83cad0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bc13960-d899-4521-9300-ae20e83cad0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d342d4f6-0baa-41d9-9215-2a6e81d6713b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "066bd81ce916348982dd2ccaf4c086b963465a64cf31d1f77d1d93290a413c75"}}, "hash": "ece50636fd3b2fa22ca6185b81886b9abeb2324d41d2676cfc985f4021068a37", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad161\nPeople who hate risk put their money in the bank. In the long run, \nsafe savings are better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get \nyour money back and, in most instances, you don\u2019t get anything for  \nfree with it. \nOn every one of my investments, there must be an upside,  \nsomething for free\u2014like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece  \nof free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there \nmust be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted \nentirely to this subject, so I will not talk about it here.

He could use it to find a stockbroker and buy and sell stocks. \nOnce he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the money would be his \nfor the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are the results?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWell, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost everything a few \ndays later.

I say this because, although  \nthe process of developing cash flow from an asset column is easy in \ntheory, what\u2019s hard is the mental fortitude to direct money to the  \ncorrect use. Due to external temptations, it is much easier in today\u2019s \nconsumer world to simply blow money out the expense column.  \nWith weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of  \nleast resistance.

Choose heroes: the power of myth\nWhen I was a kid, I greatly admired Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and  \nYogi Berra.

I pretended I was a famous baseball player. \nIt\u2019s one of the most powerful ways we learn, and we often lose that as \nadults. We lose our heroes.\nToday, I watch young kids playing basketball near my home.  \nOn the court they\u2019re not little Johnny. They\u2019re pretending to be  \ntheir favorite basketball hero.

I \nalso have heroes such as Donald T rump, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, \nGeorge Soros, and Jim Rogers. I know their stats just like I knew the \nERAs and RBIs of my childhood baseball heroes.

T each and you shall receive: the power of giving \nBoth of my dads were teachers. My rich dad taught me a lesson  \nI have carried all my life: the necessity of being charitable or giving.  \nMy educated dad gave a lot of his time and knowledge, but almost  \nnever gave away money. \nHe usually said that he would give when he had some extra money, \nbut of course there was rarely any extra.\nMy rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly \nin tithing. \u201cIf you want something, you first need to give,\u201d he would \nalways say. When he was short of money, he gave money to his church \nor to his favorite charity.\nIf I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever \nyou feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and \nit will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or \nfriendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do,  \nbut it has always worked for me. I trust that the principle of reciprocity \nis true, and I give what I want. I want money, so I give money, and  \nit comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help someone else sell  \nsomething, and sales come to me. I want contacts, and I help \nsomeone else get contacts. Like magic, contacts come to me.

In my life, \nwhenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply \nwent out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it \nfirst.

Most sellers ask too much.  \nIt is rare that a seller asks a price that is less than something is worth.\nMoral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no \nidea what it feels like to try to sell something. I have had a piece of real \nestate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed any offer. \nThey could have offered me 10 pigs, and I would have been happy\u2014\nnot at the offer, but just because someone was interested. I would have \ncountered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that\u2019s how the game \nworks. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It\u2019s fun \nand only a game. Make offers. Someone might say yes.\nI always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an \noffer with language that details \u201csubject-to\u201d contingencies, such as the \napproval of a business partner.  Never specify who the business  \npartner is. Most people don\u2019t know that my partner is my cat. If they \naccept the offer, and I don\u2019t want the deal, I call home and speak to \nmy cat. I make this ridiculous statement to illustrate how absurdly easy \nand simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and \ntake it too seriously.\n\u2022\tFinding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the \nright investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go \nto the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, \ncounteroffers, negotiate, reject, and accept. I know single \npeople who sit at home and wait for the phone to ring, but it\u2019s \nbetter to go to the market, even if it\u2019s only the supermarket. \nSearch, offer, reject, negotiate, and accept are all parts of the \nprocess of almost everything in life.\n\u2022\tJog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes.   \nI have found some of my best real estate investments doing \nthis.

I found a large \npiece of land, larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied \nit up with an option, called my friend, and he said he wanted \na piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the \nland. I kept the remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the \nstory: Buy the pie, and cut it in pieces. Most people look for \nwhat they can afford, so they look too small. They buy only \na piece of the pie, so they end up paying more for less. Small \nthinkers don\u2019t get the big breaks.

Without \nfinancial training, we all too often use the standard formulas to get through \nlife: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes. Today, more than  \never, we need better information.\nI use the following story as an example of a financial problem that  \nconfronts many young families today. How do you afford a good  \neducation for your children and provide for your own retirement?  \nIt requires using financial intelligence instead of hard work.\nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to  \nsave money for his four children\u2019s college educations. He was putting \n$300 away in a college fund each month and had so far accumulated \nonly about $12,000. He had about 12 more years to save for college \nsince his oldest child was then six years old.\nAt the time, the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People \nwere giving houses away. I suggested to my friend that he buy a house \nwith some of the money in his college fund. The idea intrigued him, \nand we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern was that \nhe did not have credit with the bank to buy another house since he \nwas so over-extended. I assured him that there were other ways to \nfinance a property rather than through the bank.\nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all our \ncriteria. There were plenty to choose from so shopping was fun. Finally, \nwe found a three-bedroom, two-bath home in a prime neighborhood. \nThe owner had been downsized and needed to sell that day because he", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "614b86e6-c524-4777-8a2c-0469091aafab": {"__data__": {"id_": "614b86e6-c524-4777-8a2c-0469091aafab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a9aeef8e-b663-4f08-9db1-911b2ca70a2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "df35bea9c4c722ae168ce5d67f33917d1292806e08e08d21087f315b237a73cb"}}, "hash": "cebbeb3ac107e310234cecc6f1d0da4d7f4521035b02248312f36207b2ac2d97", "text": "Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence174\nand his family were moving to California where another job waited. \nThe owner wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took \nit immediately and agreed to carry back the loan with a 10 percent \ndown payment. All my friend had to come up with was $7,900. As \nsoon as the owner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all \nexpenses were paid, including the mortgage, he put about $125 in his \npocket each month.\nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage \nget paid down faster by applying the extra $125 to the principal each \nmonth. We figured that in 12 years, a large portion of the mortgage \nwould be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by \nthe time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it \nhad appreciated in value.\nThree years later, the real estate market greatly improved in \nPhoenix and he was offered $156,000 for the same house by the \ntenant who lived in it. Again, he asked me what I thought. I advised \nthat he sell it, using a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.\nSuddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another \nfriend in Austin, Texas, who then moved this tax-deferred capital gain \ninto a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began receiving \nchecks for a little less than a $1,000 a month which he then poured \nback into the college fund. \nA couple of years later, the mini-warehouse sold, and he received \na check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale. He rolled those \nfunds into a new project that would now generate over $3,000 a \nmonth in income, again, going into the college fund. He is now very \nconfident that his goal will be met easily. \nIt only took $7,900 to start and a little financial intelligence. His \nchildren will be able to afford the education they want, and he will \nthen use the underlying asset, wrapped in his legal entity, to pay for his \nretirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy, he will be \nable to retire early.\nThank you for reading this book.

The average investor does not know how to protect \nthemselves from losses, and that is what CASHFLOW  202 teaches.\nAverage investors think investing is risky because they have not  \nbeen formally trained to be professional investors. As Warren Buffett, \nAmerica\u2019s richest investor says, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what \nyou\u2019re doing.\u201d My board games teach the simple basics of fundamental \ninvesting and technical investing while people are having fun.\nI occasionally hear someone say, \u201cYour educational games are \nexpensive,\u201d which poses the question of ROI, the return on investment, \nor the value returned for the price paid. I nod my head and reply, \u201cYes, \nthey may be expensive, especially when compared to entertainment board \ngames. But my games are not as expensive as a college education, working \nhard all your life for earned income, paying excessive taxes, and then \nliving in terror of losing all of your money in the investment markets.\u201d\nWhen someone walks away mumbling about the price, I can hear  \nmy rich dad saying, \u201cIf you want to be rich, you must know what kind  \nof income to work hard for, how to keep it, and how to protect it from \nloss. That is the key to great wealth.\u201d Rich dad would also say, \u201cIf you  \ndo not understand the differences in those three incomes and do not \nlearn the skills on how to acquire and protect those incomes, you will \nprobably spend your life earning less than you could and working harder \nthan you should.\u201d\nMy poor dad thought a good education, a good job, and years of \nhard work were all you needed to be successful. My rich dad also thought \na good education was important. But to him it was also important \nthat Mike and I know the differences in the three incomes and what \nkind of income to work hard for. To him, that was basic financial \neducation. Knowing the differences in the three incomes and learning \nthe investment skills of how to acquire the different incomes is basic \neducation for anyone who strives to acquire great wealth and achieve \nfinancial freedom\u2014a special kind of freedom that only a few will ever \nknow.

In 2006, Robert joined forces with \nDonald T rump to write Why We Want You To Be Rich,  a book inspired by \ntheir concern for the shrinking middle class in America. \nRobert continues to be a passionate advocate for the importance and \npower of financial education. Today, in the wake of the subprime fiasco, \nrecord home foreclosures, and a global economic meltdown that is \nstill raging, his words seem not only prophetic, but enlightened. Many \nskeptics have become believers. \nIn preparing the 2011 edition of Rich Dad\u2019s CASHFLOW Quadrant,  \nRobert realized two things: that his message and teachings have withstood \nthe test of time, and that the investment landscape, the world in which \ninvestors operate, has changed dramatically.

If I could wave my magic wand and \nyour life\u2019s path would magically appear, I would.\nSince I do not have a magic wand nor can I tell you what to do, \nthe best thing I can do is tell you what I did. And what I did was trust \nmy intuition, my heart, and my guts. For example, in 1973, returning \nfrom the war, when my poor dad suggested I go back to school, get my \nhigher degrees, and work for the government, my brain went numb, \nmy heart went heavy and my gut said, \u201cNo way.\u201d  \nWhen he suggested I get my old job back with Standard Oil or fly \nfor the airlines, again my mind, heart, and gut said no. I knew I was \nthrough sailing and flying, although they were great professions and \nthe pay was pretty good. \nIn 1973 at the age of 26, I was growing up. I had followed my \nparent\u2019s advice and gone to school, received my college degree, and had \ntwo professions: a license to be a ship\u2019s officer and a license to fly. The \nproblem was, they were professions and the dreams of a child.\nAt the age of 26, I was old enough to know that education is a process. \nFor example, when I wanted to be a ship\u2019s officer, I went to a school that \nturned out ships\u2019 officers. And when I wanted to learn to fly, I went to \nNavy flight school, a two-year process that turns non-pilots into pilots.  \nI was cautious about my next educational process. I wanted to know what \nI was going to become before I started my next educational process.\nT raditional schools had been good to me. I had achieved my \nchildhood professions. Reaching adulthood was confusing because \nthere were no signs saying, \u201cThis is the way.\u201d I knew what I didn\u2019t  want \nto do, but I did not know what I wanted  to do.\nIt would have been simple if all I wanted was a new profession.  \nIf I had wanted to be a medical doctor, I would have gone to medical \nschool. If I had wanted to be a lawyer, I would have gone to law \nschool. But I knew there was more to life than just going to school to \ngain another professional credential. \nI did not realize it at the time, but at 26 years of age, I was now \nlooking for my path in life, not my next profession.CASHFLOW Quadrant\nxvii", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a8f0da9-dc05-4288-8d48-ca215e579847": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a8f0da9-dc05-4288-8d48-ca215e579847", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "364010e2-62f0-4671-b43a-1999046246e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "ea4fc04e9597c67702b6491ac89a267dfd12b5284164fb9298c4dd559312499b"}}, "hash": "ea4fc04e9597c67702b6491ac89a267dfd12b5284164fb9298c4dd559312499b", "text": "A Different Education\nIn 1973, in my last year of active duty flying for the Marine \nCorps when I was stationed near home in Hawaii, I knew I wanted \nto follow in my rich dad\u2019s footsteps.

That is why so many \nstudents who do well in school, do not do well in real life, especially in the \nworld of money.\nAs the course progressed over the weekend, I discovered why I disliked \nschool. I realized that I loved learning, but hated school.\nT raditional education was a great environment for the \u201cA\u201d \nstudents, but it was not the environment for me. T raditional education \nwas crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of \nfear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing, and the fear of not \ngetting a job. They were programming me to be an employee in the E \nor S quadrant. I realized that traditional education is not the place for \na person who wants to be an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.\nThis may be why so many entrepreneurs never finish school\u2014\nentrepreneurs like Thomas Edison, founder of General Electric; Henry \nFord, founder of Ford Motor Company; Steve Jobs, founder of Apple; \nBill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Walt Disney, founder of Disneyland; \nand Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.\nAs the day went on and the instructor went deeper and deeper into \nthese four types of personal development, I realized I had spent most \nof my life in very harsh educational environments. After four years at \nan all-male military academy and five years as a Marine pilot, I was \npretty strong mentally and physically. As a Marine pilot, I was strong \nemotionally and spiritually, but all on the macho-male development \nside. I had no gentle side, no female energy. After all, I was trained to \nbe Marine Corps officer, emotionally calm under pressure, prepared to \nkill, and spiritually prepared to die for my country.\nIf you ever saw the movie Top Gun  starring Tom Cruise, you get \na glimpse into the masculine world and bravado of military pilots. I \nloved that world. I was good in that world. It was a modern-day world \nof knights and warriors. It was not a world for wimps.CASHFLOW Quadrant\nxix", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f37bf41-dec7-48c2-bfeb-2aedf23627cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f37bf41-dec7-48c2-bfeb-2aedf23627cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ff8242e-60e6-4304-8d8d-4a0ebee9e064", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "bced9765d1a74385ca7aaa434b23f892d5a1098223e5b6ebee3c97942183d9ac"}}, "hash": "bced9765d1a74385ca7aaa434b23f892d5a1098223e5b6ebee3c97942183d9ac", "text": "In the seminar, I went into my emotions and briefly touched my \nspirit.

The seminar had been a gentle, loving, honest environment. \nMonday morning was a shock to once again be surrounded by young \negotistical pilots, dedicated to flying, killing and dying for country.\nAfter that weekend seminar, I knew it was time to change. I knew \ndeveloping myself emotionally and spiritually to become a kinder, \ngentler, and more compassionate person would be the hardest thing \nI could do. It went against all my years at the military academy and \nflight school.\nI never returned to traditional education again. I had no desire \nto study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From \nthen on, if I did attend a course or school, I went to learn, to become \na better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees, \nand credentials. \nGrowing up in a family of teachers, your grades, the high school \nand college you graduated from, and your advanced degrees were \neverything. Like the medals and ribbons on a Marine pilot\u2019s chest, \nadvanced degrees and brand-name schools were the status and the \nstripes that educators wore on their sleeves. In their minds, people \nwho did not finish high school were the unwashed, the lost souls of \nlife. Those with master\u2019s degrees looked down on those with only \nbachelor degrees.

Once that seminar was over, I became a seminar junkie, going \nfrom seminar to seminar, finding out more about the connection \nbetween my body, my mind, my emotions, and my spirit.\nThe more I studied, the more curious about traditional education  \nI became. I began to ask questions such as:\n\u2022\tWhy do so many kids hate school?\n\u2022\tWhy do so few kids like school?\n\u2022\tWhy are many highly educated people not successful  \nin the real world?\n\u2022\tDoes school prepare you for the real world?\n\u2022\tWhy did I hate school but love learning?\n\u2022\tWhy are most schoolteachers poor?\n\u2022\tWhy do schools teach us little about money?\nThose questions led me to become a student of education outside \nthe hallowed walls of the school system. The more I studied, the more \nI understood why I did not like school and why schools failed to serve \nmost of its students, even the \u201cA\u201d students.\nMy curiosity touched my spirit, and I became an entrepreneur \nin education. If not for this curiosity, I might never have become an \nauthor and a developer of financial-education games. My spiritual \neducation led me to my path in life.\nIt seems that our paths in life are not found in our minds. Our \npath in life is to find out what is in our hearts.\nThis does not mean a person cannot find their path in traditional \neducation. I am sure many do.

We also know people who do not make a lot of money and \nhate their work. And we all know people who just work for money.\nA classmate of mine from the Merchant Marine Academy also \nrealized he did not want to spend his life at sea. Rather than sail for \nthe rest of his life, he went to law school after graduation, spending \nthree more years becoming a lawyer and entering private practice in \nthe S quadrant. \nHe died in his early fifties. He had become a very successful, \nunhappy lawyer. Like me, he had two professions by the time he was \n26. Although he hated being a lawyer, he continued being a lawyer \nbecause he had a family, kids, a mortgage, and bills to pay. \nA year before he died, I met him at a class reunion in New York. \nHe was a bitter man. \u201cAll I do is sweep up behind rich guys like you. \nThey pay me nothing.

Most people do not hate what \nthey do as much as my friend did. Yet it illustrates the problem when \na person is trapped in a profession and unable to find their path. \nTo me, this is the shortcoming of traditional education. Millions \nof people leave school, only to be trapped in jobs they do not like. \nThey know something is missing in life. Many people are also trapped \nfinancially, earning just enough to survive, wanting to earn more but \nnot knowing what to do.\nWithout awareness of the other quadrants, many people go back \nto school and look for new professions or pay raises in the E or S \nquadrant, unaware of the world of the B and I quadrants.Preface\nxxii", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "341376e6-9e17-4f96-b080-c052114fc46d": {"__data__": {"id_": "341376e6-9e17-4f96-b080-c052114fc46d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5742b1e7-8262-4272-a943-4e6beaed85f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "2af6cd92d5312c10ce415a954dbc2c266dc9189cb54a9e64319610f8dc39d24e"}}, "hash": "2af6cd92d5312c10ce415a954dbc2c266dc9189cb54a9e64319610f8dc39d24e", "text": "My Reason for Becoming a T eacher\nMy primary reason for becoming a teacher in the B quadrant was a \ndesire to provide financial education.

That is why The Rich \nDad Company started with the CASHFLOW  game. This game can teach \nin places I could never go. The beauty of the game is that it was designed \nto have people teach people. There is no need for an expensive teacher \nor classroom. The CASHFLOW  game is now translated into over sixteen \nlanguages, reaching millions of people all over the world.\nToday, The Rich Dad Company offers financial-education courses as \nwell as the services of coaches and mentors to support a person\u2019s financial \neducation.

It was hard work \nmentally, but more so emotionally and spiritually. Growing up in a \nfamily of highly educated employees in the E quadrant, I carried their \nvalues of education, job security, benefits, and a government pension. \nIn many ways, my family values made my transition difficult.

They eat to \nfeed an emptiness in their emotions and their soul. When a person \ngoes on a diet-and-exercise program, they are only working on their \nmind and their body. Without emotional development and spiritual \nstrength, the overweight person may go on a diet for six months  \nand lose a ton of weight, only to put even more weight back on later.\nThe same is true for changing quadrants. Saying to yourself,  \n\u201cI\u2019m going to become an entrepreneur in the B quadrant,\u201d is as futile \nas a chain smoker saying, \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to quit smoking.\u201d \nSmoking is a physical addiction caused by emotional and spiritual \nchallenges. Without emotional and spiritual support, the smoker  \nwill always be a smoker. The same is true for an alcoholic, a sex \naddict, or a chronic shopper. Most addictions are attempts to find \nhappiness in people\u2019s souls.\nThis is why my company offers courses for the mind and body, \nbut also coaches and mentors to support the emotional and spiritual \ntransitions.\nA few people are able to make the journey alone, but I was not \none of them.

It was a great \nplace to live except for one problem. The village had no water unless it \nrained. To solve this problem once and for all, the village elders asked \ncontractors to submit bids to deliver water to the village on a daily basis. \nT wo people volunteered to take on the task, and the elders awarded the \ncontract to both of them. They felt that a little competition would keep \nprices low and ensure a backup supply of water.\n\u201cThe first person who won the contract, Ed, immediately ran out, \nbought two galvanized steel buckets and began running back and forth \nto the lake which was a mile away. He immediately began making \nmoney as he labored morning to dusk, hauling water from the lake with \nhis two buckets. He would empty them into the large concrete holding \ntank the village had built. Each morning he had to get up before the rest \nof the village awoke to make sure there was enough water for the people. \nIt was hard work, but he was very happy to be making money and for \nhaving one of the two exclusive contracts for this business.\n\u201cThe second winning contractor, Bill, disappeared for a while.  \nHe wasn\u2019t seen for months, which made Ed very happy, since he had \nno competition. \n\u201cInstead of buying two buckets to compete with Ed, Bill wrote a \nbusiness plan, created a corporation, found four investors, employed \na president to do the work, and returned six months later with a \nconstruction crew. Within a year, his team had built a large-volume \nstainless-steel pipeline which connected the village to the lake.\n\u201cAt the grand-opening celebration, Bill announced that his  \nwater was cleaner than Ed\u2019s water. Bill knew that the villagers had \ncomplained about the water\u2019s lack of cleanliness. Bill also announced \nthat he could supply the village with water 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek. Ed could only deliver water on weekdays because he didn\u2019t want  \nto work on weekends. Then Bill announced that he would charge  \n75 percent less than Ed did for this higher-quality, more-reliable water. \nThe villagers cheered and immediately ran for the faucet at the end  \nof Bill\u2019s pipeline.\n5CASHFLOW Quadrant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cc92ed0-d486-4b6c-b3ea-262ad03693bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cc92ed0-d486-4b6c-b3ea-262ad03693bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19471107-d52d-4521-a642-f4785afb66d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad.pdf"}, "hash": "96465338012e8c964b50933ef37e6ee70bfdc8e5618ed1b23889b82d222906cb"}}, "hash": "96465338012e8c964b50933ef37e6ee70bfdc8e5618ed1b23889b82d222906cb", "text": "\u201cIn order to compete, Ed immediately lowered his rates by  \n75 percent, bought two more buckets, added covers to his buckets \nand began hauling four buckets each trip.

When his boys went off to college, he said to them, \n\u2018Hurry back because someday this business will belong to you.\u2019\n\u201cFor some reason, his two sons never returned. Eventually, Ed had \nemployees and union problems. The union demanded higher wages \nand better benefits and wanted its members to only haul one bucket \nat a time.\n\u201cMeanwhile, Bill realized that if this village needed water, then \nother villages must need water too. He rewrote his business plan and \nwent off to sell his high-speed, high-volume, low-cost, clean-water \ndelivery system to villages throughout the world.
